# Feature Selection

How many years do we have? 

1961 to 1991 (USSR), other countries appear until 2008

Aarun chose Country, Year, Production (Yield)

In a regression analysis, dependent variable would be production, the independent variable would be year


# Data Wrangling

We choose to drop the rows with NaN values on our analysis when comparing BRICS countries 


# Questions 

- Comparison of countries which lead crop production (we can simply analyze the top 5, top 7, top 10 produces)

- Does agricultural production in the USSR decline through time? (This can be modeled by a simple time series plotting the year and the total production, this can be also tackled through hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis would be that agricultural production in the USSR *increases*). 

- Regression analysis to predict if a country's production will increase/decrease in time. (Should we just model this as a time series?) We can do both, actually.
